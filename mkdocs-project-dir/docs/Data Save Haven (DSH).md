# Data Save Haven (DSH)

It is a secure, isolated environment where sensitive data can be stored, processed, and analyzed, 
while maintaining strict security measures to protect the confidentiality and privacy of individuals.

Data safe havens are essential for conducting research that involves sensitive information like 
healthcare data, financial records, or other personal data. They allow researchers to access and 
analyze this data while adhering to strict data protection laws and ethical guidelines. By ensuring
the security and confidentiality of sensitive data, data safe havens help build trust and foster 
collaboration in research.

[UCL DSH service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/file-storage-sharing/data-safe-haven-dsh) is
composed by two parts: The DSH desktop and the DSH cluster. 

The DSH Desktop is a Windows Virtual Desktop. There are a number of virtual machines (VMs) that allows
multiple concurrent interactive sessions. New sessions are connected to a virtual machine with the least load.
