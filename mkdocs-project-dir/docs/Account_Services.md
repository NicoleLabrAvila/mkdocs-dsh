# Account Services

UCL DSH service is composed by two parts: The DSH desktop and the DSH cluster.

The DSH Desktop is a Windows Virtual Desktop. There are a number of virtual machines (VMs) that allows multiple concurrent 
interactive sessions. New sessions are connected to a virtual machine with the least load. 

The DSH cluster is a set of machines in an isolated environment and it is accessed only from the DSH desktop.  

## DSH account application

Internal UCL users and external users can apply for a DSH account but before to do so, the user must have completed the 
(**NHS Digitalâ€™s Data Security Awareness (NHSD) course provided by e-Learning for Health**)[https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/register]
in the last 12 months.  This training is mandatory for all members. For more information, please visit:

Once the course is finished, the applicant must upload the training certification here:

    Note: If the user does not have a UCL account please use their email address in the 'DSH User ID' field.
    
All granted applications give you a DSH windows portal and access to the DSH cluster from there. You will then receive an email when 
your account is approved.

## DSH account access

Once the account is created, the ISD team will provide the user with the necessary information to gain access to the DSH. 
What is a token?
What is a share?
It is required a mobile phone number or an alternative e-mail address for the user, this is to provide the PIN number separately 
from the Token for security purposes. This information  is stored securely and used only for this purpose. After the password 
and PIN has been changed, users will get access to the DSH portals and their shares.

The DSH webpage is composed by 3 portals: [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/file-storage-sharing/data-safe-haven/dsh-data-safe-haven-portals]
