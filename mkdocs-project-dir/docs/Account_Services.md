# Account Services

UCL DSH service is composed by two parts: The DSH desktop and the DSH cluster.

The DSH Desktop is a Windows Virtual Desktop. There are a number of virtual machines (VMs) that allows multiple concurrent 
interactive sessions. New sessions are connected to a virtual machine with the least load. 

The DSH cluster is a set of machines in an isolated environment and it is accessed only from the DSH desktop.  

## DSH account application

To apply for an account to DSH clusters you must fill in the following form in MyServices: [https://uk.4me.io/cnQ9MjkzNw]
The person must also read and sign the Acceptable Use Statement prior to submitting this request.

You can request a new user account for members of your team if the person has completed the (**NHS Digitalâ€™s Data Security 
Awareness (NHSD) course provided by e-Learning for Health**)[https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/register] in the last 12 months.  
This training is mandatory for members of UCL who manage highly confidential research information, including principal and 
chief investigators, staff, students, senior managers, and even those who just supervise people who directly handle confidential
information, and support staff who do not have direct access to data. For more information, please visit: 
[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/information-governance-training-awareness-service].

Once the course is finished, the applicant must upload the training certification here: 
[https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/ISD.IGAdvisoryService/Lists/Training%20Certification/NewForm.aspx?pa=1]

*Please note in order for the person to upload the training completion certificate and sign the acceptable use statement they
require an active UCL account.*


For external users there are some additional steps so submit this request and we will provide instructions on what to do next.

    A DSH user account is needed to use the Data Safe Haven Service, and the account holder will be required to register and renew IG training with the Information Governance Training & Awareness Service every 12 months.
    We no longer run inductions sessions and instead provide the user with the necessary information to gain access to the DSH. However we now require a mobile phone number or an alternative e-mail address for the user, this is to provide the PIN number separately from the Token for security purposes. We will only use this information for this purpose and will be stored securely. After the password and PIN has been changed users will get access to the DSH portals and their shares.
    Joiners must be a member of at least one share, enter the name of the share in the New User Account form. You can add to additional shares using the Add/Remove to share process described below. If the share does not exist please also submit a New Share request. DSH users who are not a member of any share will be disabled.

    Note: The Information Asset Administrator (IAA) does not need to have a DSH account.
    Note: If the user does not have a UCL account please use their email address in the 'DSH User ID' field.



All granted applications give you a DSH windows portal and access to the DSH cluster from there. You will then receive an email when your account is approved

The DSH webpage is composed by 3 portals: [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/file-storage-sharing/data-safe-haven/dsh-data-safe-haven-portals]
