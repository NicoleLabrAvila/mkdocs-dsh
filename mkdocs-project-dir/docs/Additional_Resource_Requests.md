## Request hosting of shared datasets

We have provision for hosting shared datasets for users in DSH. These
can be datasets that are freely accessible by all users, or ones limited
to groups.

Hosted datasets:

  - Will not be backed up.
  - Must have a named primary contact.
  - Must be reapplied for every 12 months to make sure they are still
    current and required.
  - Will have an associated quota.
  - Will be removed when renewal lapses (notice will be given).

They are likely to be managed by a role account - access to the role
account will be by ssh key.

To apply for a hosted dataset, please contact
<rc-support@ucl.ac.uk>.



For further advice or information on future hardware options, please
